# ABOUT

A very simple plugin which implements "per-project" nvim-dap debugger adapters
and configurations. 

This plugin allows source code maintainers to place a `nvim-dap` configuration
file in a configurable location in their repository. When this plugin discovers
the file it will only display the debugger configurations within this project 
local configuration. 

Original code base was sourced from: `https://github.com/ldelossa/nvim-dap-projects`


## Installation

Using plug or your favorite plugin manager:
```
...
    Plug 'kilisio/nvim-dap-projects'
```
